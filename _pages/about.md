I am an undergraduate student at **McGill University**, majoring in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. My research interests lie at the intersection of **agricultural economics**, **agribusiness**, **environmental and resource economics**, and **applied econometrics**.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the **Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs** (China) and the **Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences**, where I contribute to research on agricultural productivity and policy evaluation. Previously, I studied at **Peking University's Guanghua School of Management** as an exchange student.

My recent research focuses on:
- Carbon pricing policy impacts on green innovation
- Agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) and spatial spillover effects
- Applied econometric methods for policy evaluation
- Sustainability and innovation in agri-food systems

I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to address challenges in agricultural economics and environmental policy.
